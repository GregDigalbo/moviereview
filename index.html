<h1> The Force Awakens</h1>
<img src="poster.jpg"/>
<p>
This is the 7th installment in the star wars series. Continuing from where the second trilogy had left off.
  <h2> Various movie reviews:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>IMBD: Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a ragtag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance.</li>
  <li> Rotten tomatos: Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy.</li>
<li> The Washington Post: The Force Awakens strikes all the right chords, emotional and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new. Filled with incident, movement and speed, dusted with light layers of tarnished “used future” grime, it captures the kinetic energy that made the first film, from 1977, such a revelation to filmgoers who marveled at Lucas’s mashup of B movies, Saturday-morning serials, Japanese historical epics and mythic heft.</li>
</ul>
